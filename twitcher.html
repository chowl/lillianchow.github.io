			<td><td style="padding:5%">The Problem:</br> College Admissions Officers and job recruiters often have the job of looking through profiles of potential candidates to see if they are eligible. Our program could be a helpful tool for the students or individuals looking into cleaning up their profile.</td></td></br>
			
			<td>The Solution:</br>Our program created an easy and efficient way to complete that with Twitter feeds. In the future, we would like to see the program expanded to other social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. Another tool that would be helpful is searching for images, which can easily be implemented with the allotted time. If there was more time, we also came up with the idea of having a feature to clear the data filtered. This could be a helpful tool for the students or individuals looking into cleaning up their profile.</td></br>

			<td>Technical Hurdles:</br>When working the Python program into a website, we used the microframework Flask. Flask was difficult to understand, and required changes in our Python program such as in our RegEx. After looking up a lot of documentation and utilizing our teachers and TAs, we were able to execute the program.</td></br>

			<td>Final project for Girls Who Code. Takes the Twitter API and pulls all the tweets from an entered Twitter handle. Then uses the selected filter which is programmed with Regular Expressions to filter through the data. All tweets containing words from the filter will then be outputted with the word it was flagged for at the end. The top will also state how many times the inputed user was flagged for the filter. (Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, RegEx, Bootstrap, Flask)</td></br>
