				<p>The goal of this project was to design a device to <b>monitor infants</b> for the early symptoms of infant death, i.e. body temperature, humidity and skin color changes. The use of wearable technology is advantageous due to light-weight properties, lack of heat build-up, and durability. The device would be made with wearable circuits, making them less prone to irritation, excessive heat, etc. </p>
                  
                  <p>In 2015, there were 3700 <b>Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths</b> (SUID) in the United States among infants less than 1 year old. The three most common SUID include SIDS, unknown cause, and accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed. Though there have been inconclusive studies as to why this happens, there have been successful research studies that have proven symptoms such as changes in body temperature, fluctuations in blood pressure, and shifts in heart rate occur before the child dies. Research has determined some of the risk factors that increase a child’s probability of SUID or SIDS since a majority of the infant deaths are attributed to <b>unsafe sleep practices</b> and environments. For example, bed sharing, loose bedding, wedging and entrapment, and an environment that promote infant over heating are considered unsafe sleep practices. The “Back to Sleep” campaign, now called the <b>“Safe to Sleep” campaign</b>, was introduced in the 1994, to reduce possibility of strangulation or suffocation. There has been approximately a 50% reduction in deaths since the introduction of the campaign, but SIDS remain the leading cause of post-neonatal mortality.</p>
                  
                  <p>In the past, teams have developed wearable technologies for monitoring children. However, current technologies are not targeted at sensing symptoms of SIDS or SUID, but simply monitoring the <b>heart rate</b> of a child. The senseSack was designed completely from individual components. This includes both the hardware and software portions of the project as well as the electronic and non-electronic components.</p>
                  
                  <p>The design of the senseSack is simple and effective. Each <b>wearable sensor</b>, designed for human contact, collects data. They then communicate with the mobile device due to the Bluetooth chip in the circuit. While designing the senseSack, temperature tests were taken to measure the <b>accuracy</b> of the sack with heat retention. Not only was the senseSack able to measure the decrease in temperature, but also the temperature inside the sack. Thus, it was concluded the senseSack would be able to accurately measure a drop in temperature.</p> 
                  
                  <p>The senseSack is a <b>cost effective</b> and seemingly simple idea with the potential to reduce the probability of a child having SIDS or SUID. One of the device's purposes is to use the senseSack as a <b>predictive analytics model</b> in hospitals and/or homes. This sleepsack will enable early warning of health hazards giving guardians greater peace of mind and users greater comfort in knowing the reliability of the product.</p>
                  
                  <p>The current design of the product leaves room for potential improvements. One of those and one of the easiest, is adding more sensors to the product. The <b>multiplexer</b> is in place to continue expanding upon the product. An app for the product would be fully developed to ensure ease of use for individuals.</p>

                  <p>The <b>hardware</b> for the project was put together by myself utilizing components purchased from adafruit.com or sparkfun.com. The software was programmed by myself in <b>Arduino</b>.</p>
